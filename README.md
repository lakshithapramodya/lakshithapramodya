### Hi there üëã

I'm a passionate web developer with a keen eye for design and a love for solving complex problems. Through my self-taught journey, I've gained experience in building functional and visually appealing websites using various web-based technologies. I'm always eager to learn new skills and keep up-to-date with the latest industry trends. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, playing video games, or spending time in nature. I'm excited to collaborate with like-minded individuals and build innovative web applications that make a positive impact.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools
It wouldn't make sense to post every tool and language I've ever worked with, but here are some I am most comfortable with at the moment.
